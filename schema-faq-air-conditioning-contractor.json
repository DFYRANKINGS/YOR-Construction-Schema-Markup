Avoid contractors who can't provide license numbers or proof of insurance :cite[5]:cite[8]."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Professional contractors use: (1) **Manual J calculations** (factors in square footage, insulation, windows, and local climate :cite[2]:cite[7]), (2) **Ductwork evaluation** (checks for leaks/sizing issues), and (3) **Load calculations** (accounts for heat-generating appliances and occupancy). For example, a 2,000 sq ft home typically needs 3-5 tons (36,000-60,000 BTU) but varies by region (e.g., Southern homes need 20% more capacity than Northern ones) :cite[2]:cite[7]. Oversized units cause humidity issues, while undersized units overwork :cite[7]."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Standard maintenance includes: (1) **Seasonal tune-ups** (check refrigerant, clean coils, calibrate thermostats) :cite[8], (2) **Filter replacement** (every 1-3 months) :cite[9], (3) **Drain line flushing** (prevents clogs with vinegar/bleach) :cite[9], (4) **Electrical inspection** (tests capacitors/contactors) :cite[4], and (5) **Duct cleaning** (every 3-5 years). Premium plans may offer priority scheduling and discounts :cite[8]. Neglecting maintenance reduces efficiency by 5% annually :cite[4]."

Delays occur during peak summer months due to high demand :cite[3]."
