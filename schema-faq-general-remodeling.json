      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Remodeling warranties typically include: (1) **Workmanship** (1-5 years covering installation defects), (2) **Materials** (varies by manufacturer - e.g., 25 years for CertainTeed siding), and (3) **Structural** (10+ years for load-bearing changes). Warranties often require proof of professional installation and proper maintenance. Always get warranty terms in writing - 68% of contractors offer limited coverage unless specified otherwise."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Budgeting guidelines: (1) Allocate 20% for contingencies (unexpected structural issues), (2) Break down costs: 35% labor, 25% materials, 15% fixtures/appliances, 10% permits/fees, 15% design/management, (3) Prioritize 'must-haves' vs. 'nice-to-haves', (4) Get 3 detailed bids (compare line items not just totals). The average full-home remodel costs $100-$200/sq ft - high-end projects exceed $400/sq ft in urban areas."
