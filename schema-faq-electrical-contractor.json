      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Reputable electrical contractors must have: (1) **State electrical license** (e.g., C-10 in California, EC in Texas), (2) **Master Electrician certification** for the lead technician, (3) **General liability insurance** ($1M+ coverage), and (4) **Workers' compensation**. Verify licenses through your state's licensing board (like CSLB in CA) - unlicensed work voids most home insurance policies for electrical-related claims."

      "name": "Will you pull the necessary permits and ensure work complies with current codes?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Professional electricians: (1) **Pull all required permits** ($75-$500 depending on project scope), (2) **Adhere to current NEC codes** (2023 standards with local amendments), and (3) **Schedule inspections** (rough-in and final). They provide documentation of compliance - ask for their methodology on code updates (e.g., AFCIs in all living spaces per NEC 2020). DIY electrical work often fails inspection due to improper grounding or box fill calculations."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Top contractors utilize: (1) **Diagnostic tools** - Thermal imaging cameras, circuit analyzers, and megohmmeters, (2) **Safety gear** - Voltage-rated gloves and arc flash protection, (3) **Installation equipment** - Hydraulic benders for conduit, laser alignment tools, and (4) **Certified teams** - Journeyman electricians (8,000+ training hours) supervised by Master Electricians. They should disclose crew size - typically 2-3 electricians for whole-house rewires."

      "name": "How do you ensure the qualifications and training of your electricians?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Verification includes: (1) **State certification cards** (verify through DOL), (2) **Ongoing training** - Annual NEC update courses and manufacturer certifications (e.g., Generac for generators), (3) **OSHA 30 certification** for safety, and (4) **Apprenticeship ratios** - Max 1 apprentice per journeyman. Ask for individual credentials - 34% of electrical failures stem from improperly trained workers according to ESFI."

      "name": "What are your policies regarding project timelines, payment terms, and workplace safety?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Professional standards: (1) **Timelines** - Written schedule with 10-15% contingency time, (2) **Payments** - 30% deposit, progress payments tied to inspections, final 10% after approval, (3) **Safety** - Lockout/tagout procedures, daily hazard briefings, and MSDS access. Beware contractors requesting >50% upfront - the industry standard is 30% max deposit for electrical work."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Quality contractors supply: (1) **3-5 recent references** (call to ask about cleanup and communication), (2) **Inspection records** - Proof of passed final inspections, (3) **Project photos** - Showing proper wiring methods (neat 90Â° bends, correct box fill), and (4) **Online reviews** - Check BBB for complaint patterns. For large projects (>$10K), request to visit a completed job site."
