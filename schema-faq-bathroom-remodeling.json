        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Average costs range from **$6,000–$25,000**. Allocate: 50% for labor, 20% fixtures, 15% tiles, 15% contingencies. Mid-range remodels (~$15,000) often include tile showers and mid-grade vanities. Luxury projects ($$$) prioritize heated floors or smart mirrors."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "**Fixtures**: Opt for water-efficient EPA WaterSense models. **Tiles**: Porcelain resists moisture; natural stone needs sealing. **Layouts**: 30”x60” is standard for single-sink bathrooms; wet rooms save space but require slope flooring."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "**Ventilation**: Install a 50–80 CFM exhaust fan (duct outside, not attic). **Lighting**: Layer ambient (ceiling), task (mirror), and accent lights. **Moisture**: Use mold-resistant drywall (green board) and waterproof membranes behind tiles."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Focus on: (1) **Large-format tiles**—fewer grout lines; (2) **Floating vanities**—easier floor cleaning; (3) **Quartz countertops**—stain-resistant; (4) **Semi-frameless glass showers**—reduce hard water buildup. Neutral palettes (grays, whites) hide wear better than bold colors."
