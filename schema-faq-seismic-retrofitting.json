        "text": "Seismic retrofitting modifies existing structures to improve earthquake resistance, focusing on structural weaknesses like unbraced foundations or soft-story designs. It's critical for: (1) Pre-1980s buildings (especially pre-1970s in California), (2) Soft-story structures (e.g., apartments over garages), (3) Hillside homes, (4) Unreinforced masonry buildings, and (5) Regions with high seismic activity (e.g., West Coast, Japan). Retrofitting addresses risks identified in FEMA 154 rapid visual screenings :cite[1]:cite[3]:cite[7]."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Costs vary by method and property type: (1) **Basic bolting**: $500-$3,000 (foundation to frame), (2) **Cripple wall bracing**: $1,000-$3,000, (3) **Shear wall reinforcement**: $3,000-$6,000, (4) **Full-home retrofits**: $3,500-$8,700 average ($3-$7/sq ft). Special cases: Hillside homes ($7,000-$20,000), soft-story buildings ($20,000-$350,000). Mobile homes cost $2,000-$13,000 for bracing systems :cite[2]:cite[7]:cite[9]."

      "name": "Do I need a permit for seismic retrofit work?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Permit requirements depend on: (1) **Project scope** - Structural modifications typically require permits (2) **Local codes** - California mandates permits for soft-story retrofits under SB 8/SB 326 (3) **Building height** - Retrofits for walls >4 ft often need engineered plans. The permitting process takes 1-8 weeks (faster with automated systems like SolarAPP+). Contractors usually handle permits :cite[5]:cite[7]:cite[9]."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Vet contractors by: (1) **Verifying licenses** (check CSLB for contractors, BPELSG for engineers in CA), (2) **Reviewing experience** (minimum 5 completed retrofits in your area), (3) **Checking insurance** ($1M+ general liability coverage), (4) **Validating references** (inspect 3+ past projects), (5) **Confirming code knowledge** (ASCE 41, FEMA 154 standards). Avoid contractors who can't provide documentation :cite[3]:cite[8]."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Top methods by application: (1) **Foundation bolting** - Prevents structure sliding ($500-$3,000), (2) **Shear walls** - Plywood/steel reinforcement for lateral strength ($3,000-$6,000), (3) **Moment frames** - Steel frameworks for multi-story buildings, (4) **Base isolation** - Decouples building from ground motion (premium option), (5) **FRP wrapping** - Fiber-reinforced polymers strengthen columns. For soft-story buildings, steel moment frames are most effective :cite[1]:cite[6]:cite[7]."

      "name": "How long does the retrofitting process usually take?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Timelines vary: (1) **Basic bolting**: 1-3 days, (2) **Standard raised-foundation home**: 1 week (2,000 sq ft), (3) **Hillside homes**: 2-4 weeks, (4) **Soft-story retrofits**: 1-3 months. Total project time (including permits/engineering) typically spans 4-12 weeks. Construction itself represents only 20-30% of the timeline - planning and approvals dominate the schedule :cite[5]:cite[7]:cite[9]."
