        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Reputable commercial contractors should demonstrate: (1) 5+ completed projects in your specific sector (retail, healthcare, industrial etc.), (2) Familiarity with your project size (e.g., $2M+ budgets if applicable), (3) Experience with local zoning/compliance requirements, and (4) Specialized trade partnerships (MEP, structural etc.). Ask for case studies showing project challenges/solutions - quality firms track this data across all projects."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Minimum thresholds vary by project complexity: (1) Small projects (<$1M): 5+ years acceptable, (2) Mid-size ($1-10M): 10+ years preferred, (3) Large-scale (>$10M): 15+ years ideal. Verify via: (a) Business license records, (b) Bonding history (look for continuous coverage), and (c) Equipment ownership (long-term contractors invest in specialized machinery). Newer firms may qualify if leadership has 20+ years combined experience."

Request their EMR (Experience Modification Rate) - scores <1.0 indicate better-than-average safety records."
