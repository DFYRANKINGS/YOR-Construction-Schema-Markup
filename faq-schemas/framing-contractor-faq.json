        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, hiring a licensed and insured framing contractor is critical for structural work. Licensed framers (e.g., C-5 license holders in California) demonstrate 4+ years of verified experience and pass trade/law exams :cite[1]. Insurance ($1M+ general liability) protects you from injury lawsuits and subpar work :cite[6]. Unlicensed contractors risk voiding home insurance coverage and lack recourse for defects :cite[2]:cite[10]."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Key risks include: (1) **No permits** - Illegal work can't be inspected, risking code violations :cite[2]; (2) **Injury liability** - Homeowners may pay medical costs for worker injuries :cite[6]; (3) **No warranties** - 78% of unlicensed framers offer no workmanship guarantees :cite[6]; (4) **Resale issues** - Undisclosed unpermitted work requires costly remediation when selling :cite[10]."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Most framing projects require permits, especially for: (1) New construction :cite[8]; (2) Structural repairs (e.g., termite damage exceeding 10% of members) :cite[10]; (3) Additions altering load paths :cite[4]. Licensed contractors typically pull permits ($150-$800), while unlicensed ones shift this burden to homeowners :cite[2]. Always verify permit status with your local building department."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Inspect for: (1) **Proper sistering** - New studs should overlap damaged ones by 3+ feet :cite[10]; (2) **Moisture control** - Treated lumber and vapor barriers in repaired areas :cite[3]; (3) **Alignment** - Laser-check wall plumbness (â‰¤1/4\" variance over 8 ft) :cite[8]; (4) **Termite mitigation** - Soil treatments or borate wood preservatives applied post-repair :cite[7]. Request before/after photos from similar projects."

Delays occur from permit approvals (2-8 weeks) or material shortages :cite[4]. Get written estimates specifying change order fees."
