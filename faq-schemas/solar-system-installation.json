        "text": "Key evaluation criteria include: (1) **Structural integrity** - Roof must support 3-4 lbs/sq ft additional weight (professional inspection recommended) :cite[1]; (2) **Orientation** - South-facing roofs in northern hemisphere yield 15-25% more energy :cite[1]; (3) **Shading** - Use tools like PVsyst to analyze obstructions (trees/buildings) :cite[1]; (4) **Material/age** - Asphalt shingles (most compatible) should have 10+ years remaining lifespan; tile/metal require specialized mounts :cite[9]; (5) **Space** - Typical home needs 335-405 sq ft for 20-25 panels :cite[9]."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Timelines vary: (1) **Permitting** - 1-8 weeks (traditional) vs. instant approval with SolarAPP+ :cite[10]; (2) **Installation** - 1-3 days for residential systems; (3) **Interconnection** - 2-6 weeks for utility approval. Using automated tools like SolarTRACE can reduce total timeline from 20+ weeks to as little as 4 weeks :cite[10]. Complex roofs or areas with backlogged inspectors may experience delays."

Note: Subsidies/rebates may reduce eligible credit amounts :cite[2]. Solar roofing tiles qualify, but structural components don't :cite[2]."

EnergySage's ranking system compares 5 key metrics :cite[6]."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Minimal maintenance needed: (1) **Cleaning** - 2-4 times yearly with soft brush/distilled water (morning hours) :cite[4]:cite[7]; (2) **Inspections** - Check for cracks/animal nests annually :cite[7]; (3) **Monitoring** - Use apps to track 15%+ production drops :cite[7]. Rain cleans tilted panels naturally. Avoid abrasive tools/hot water (risk glass cracking) :cite[4]. Most damage is covered by warranties :cite[7]."

Solar SME reports 42% of installations require roof work :cite[9]. Consider combined roof+solar financing to offset costs :cite[8]."
