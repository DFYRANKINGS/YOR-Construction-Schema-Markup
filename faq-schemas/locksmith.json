        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Google has imposed strict verification measures due to rampant spam and fake listings in the locksmith industry. Scammers historically created thousands of fraudulent profiles, prompting Google to blacklist the term 'locksmith' in business listings. Legitimate locksmiths now struggle because: (1) Verification methods (mail, phone, email) often don’t suit mobile locksmiths without physical addresses; (2) National brands/kiosks get prioritized due to established authority; (3) Google’s limited resources make manual reviews rare, leaving legitimate businesses vulnerable to hijacked listings :cite[1]:cite[6]."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Consumers can avoid scams by: (1) **Avoiding toll-free numbers (800/866/877)**—legitimate locksmiths use local numbers; (2) **Verifying physical addresses**—scammers often claim to be 'mobile-only' or 'between locations'; (3) **Checking BBB membership**—scammers lack approvals; (4) **Demanding marked vehicles/uniforms**—unmarked cars are a red flag; (5) **Requesting written quotes upfront**—scammers inflate prices after starting work. For businesses, securing listings with Google’s domain verification and monitoring for unauthorized changes is critical :cite[1]:cite[9]."

Reputable companies like Chicago Locksmiths emphasize 24/7 availability and sub-30-minute resolutions for emergencies :cite[3]:cite[5]:cite[8]."
