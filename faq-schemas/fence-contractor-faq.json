        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Recommended fence styles by purpose: (1) **Security**: 6-8 ft tall privacy fences (vinyl or metal with anti-climb features), (2) **Pet containment**: 4-6 ft high aluminum or wood with narrow picket spacing, (3) **Pool safety**: 4-5 ft high with self-closing gates (meeting local codes), (4) **Decorative**: Ornamental iron or short picket fences (3-4 ft), (5) **Noise reduction**: 6-8 ft solid wood or composite with sound-absorbing materials."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Material comparison: (1) **Vinyl**: 20-30 year lifespan, annual cleaning only, (2) **Wood**: 15-20 years, requires staining every 2-3 years, (3) **Aluminum**: 25+ years, occasional cleaning, (4) **Chain link**: 15-20 years, rust prevention needed, (5) **Composite**: 25+ years, no painting/staining. Climate considerations: Wood warps in humidity, vinyl may crack in extreme cold, and metal conducts heat in sunny areas."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Common regulations: (1) Height limits (typically 6 ft for backyards, 4 ft for front yards), (2) Setback requirements (2-8 ft from property lines), (3) HOA approvals for style/color, (4) Pool fence laws (self-latching gates, no climbable features). Most areas require permits for fences over 4 ft tall - contractors typically handle this process for $50-$300."

Additional costs: Gates ($300-$2,500), removal of old fence ($3-$8 per ft), and terrain adjustments (slopes add 15-30%). Get 3-5 quotes as prices vary by 20-40% regionally."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Vetting checklist: (1) Verify state license through contractor board, (2) Request Certificate of Insurance ($1M+ liability), (3) Check BBB rating and local reviews, (4) Ask for 3 recent references, (5) Confirm they handle permits/surveys, (6) Look for manufacturer certifications (e.g., CertainTeed for vinyl). Avoid contractors who demand full payment upfront - 30-50% deposit is standard."

Factors affecting schedule: (a) Weather (no concrete work in freezing temps), (b) Material availability (vinyl may have 2-4 week lead times), (c) Utility markouts (48-72 hours required). Professional contractors provide written schedules with weather contingencies."
