      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Choose DIY for cosmetic updates (painting, backsplash, hardware) if you have skills and time. Hire a contractor for structural changes (wall removal, plumbing/electrical work), cabinet installation, or complex layouts. Professionals ensure code compliance and often complete projects 30-50% faster. Always get 3+ quotes for comparison."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Average costs range from $12,000 (minor) to $60,000+ (luxury). Mid-range remodels ($25,000-$35,000) typically include: semi-custom cabinets ($8,000-$15,000), quartz countertops ($3,000-$6,000), and appliance packages ($4,000-$8,000). Labor accounts for 30-35% of total costs. Get itemized quotes to avoid surprises."

      "name": "Are IKEA kitchens worth it for remodeling?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, for budget-conscious homeowners seeking modular designs. IKEA cabinets cost 40-60% less than custom ($3,000-$10,000 for average kitchen) with 25-year warranties. Downsides: Flat-pack assembly requires DIY skills or third-party installers, and door styles are limited. Pair with custom countertops for higher-end look."

      "name": "Why do kitchen renovations take so long?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Delays stem from: (1) Material lead times (custom cabinets: 8-12 weeks); (2) Inspection hold-ups; (3) Contractor scheduling; (4) Unforeseen issues (wiring, plumbing, structural). Average timeline: 6-12 weeks. Minimize delays by ordering materials early and adding 15% buffer time to estimates."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Key steps: (1) Create a master schedule coordinating plumbers, electricians, and carpenters; (2) Order all materials before demolition (critical path: cabinets → countertops → appliances); (3) Use a general contractor to manage subs or apps like BuilderTrend for DIY coordination. Always confirm delivery dates in writing."
